#|The functions take, drop and merge are linear because we have basic termination condition. we start with one
element and continue with its successor.
The basic termination for the functions take and drop is if xs is null and then we have the empty
list and in merge we have two of them because merge is also a tree recursion so  we
check for both xs and ys if they are null. if they arent null we continue with
the recursion and call take drop or merge until the termination condition is fullfilled.
in merge sort we also terminate if our input n is lesser than 2 but after that we dont use the
successor of our element but instead use half of it.

both merge and merge-sort are tree recursions as we use either merge or merge-sort two times during
one recursion.
take and drop arent tree-recursions because we have just one recursiv call

merge-sort is also a nested recursion because we call not only merge-sort but take drop and merge
as well
none of the other functions is nested as they only call themselves

all of the functions are direct because they dont mutually call each other
therefore none of them are indirect
we also dont have end-recursion.

#|
 merge as well as merge-sort are functions of higher order because both of them take a function (rel<?)
as an input

;this function is to hide the accumulator
(define (take-sum n xs)
  (take n xs '()))
;this function is the new take with end recursion
(define (take n xs acc)
  (cond
    [(null? xs ) acc] ;instead of the empty list we have acc as output acc is basicly the new list wich we want to take from the old list
    [(= 0 n) acc]
    [else (take (- n 1) (cdr xs) (cons (car xs) acc  ))])) ;we basicly add the first element of the list xs to acc and continue the recursion with xs minus the first element and n minus one because we already took one element
(require racket/trace);so we can use trace
(trace take-sum)
(trace take)
(take-sum 5 (list 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)) ;exmaplary use of take-sum we trace both take and take-sum to see the end recursion
